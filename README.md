Bootcamp Session: AI-102 - Get Started with Azure AI Services
üéì Speaker: Saurav Raghuvanshi (Azure PaaS Engineer @ Microsoft)
üóìÔ∏è Date: 13th October 2024


The session introduced Azure AI Services, emphasizing how Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables machines to mimic human-like capabilities such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and text generation. It explored AI's evolution, starting from traditional AI to more specialized fields like Machine Learning and Deep Learning. A key focus was on Generative AI, which can create new content, including text, images, and audio, based on given prompts. The historical timeline covered milestones from 1956 to the latest advancements in 2021. This insightful session demonstrated how Azure AI can be leveraged for real-world applications.

The session also highlighted the importance of Responsible AI and Ethics in developing and deploying AI technologies. Key principles include fairness, ensuring AI treats all users equally; reliability and safety, ensuring systems perform as expected; and maintaining privacy and security of data. Emphasizing inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability were also critical points, ensuring that AI systems are accessible and understandable to all, with clear responsibility for outcomes. These guidelines ensure AI development aligns with ethical standards to build trust in its usage.
The session proceeded with a demonstration on provisioning Azure AI services resources. This hands-on demo walked participants through setting up AI services in the Azure portal, highlighting key steps like selecting resource groups, choosing AI services (such as Cognitive Services or Machine Learning), and configuring essential settings. The demo emphasized ease of use, showing how developers can quickly scale and deploy AI models. By the end, attendees gained practical knowledge on creating and managing AI services in Azure for real-world applications.

The session also featured a live demo on creating a Container Instance in Azure. The speaker demonstrated how to deploy containerized applications directly from the Azure portal, walking through steps such as specifying the container image, configuring resource allocations, and setting networking options. This demo showcased the simplicity of running containers in a scalable and managed environment, with minimal infrastructure management. Attendees learned how container instances can be a powerful tool for running lightweight, isolated workloads in the cloud.
Additionally, the session included a demonstration on cost prediction for Azure AI services. The speaker showcased how to estimate the cost of deploying and running AI services using Azure's built-in cost management tools. By adjusting variables such as resource type, region, and usage patterns, attendees learned how to forecast expenses and optimize their budgets. The demo provided practical insights into controlling cloud costs while maintaining efficient AI operations, helping developers plan and manage resources effectively.
